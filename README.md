# trust-tools
Our cross-disciplinary team is working to design and develop tools which will redress the power imbalance which is implicit in long-winded terms and conditions, empowering customers to make informed decisions regarding their personal data, and enabling brands to demonstrate their commitment to trustworthiness and openness. Current work is focussed on a browser extension which will parse terms and conditions, compare them to user preferences, and flag any deviations.

Rebuild trust in relationships between consumers and brands.

## What do we need to do?
Which milestones are we working towards at the moment? If you see an opportunity to get involved, please drop us a note below.

## Milestone: Collaborate on decision tree modelling
Date: 26/09
This week we are working on finalising the design for the decision tree a consumer will interact with when setting their preferences. The work is based on a document sent out to nPower customers entitled 'using your personal information - our fair processing (privacy) notice'. This is available as a PDF on the nPower website.

## Milestone: Release white paper
Date: 02/10
We will publish the white paper that the team has been working on to lay the groundwork for the upcoming tool development.

## Milestone: Prepare for upcoming events
Dates: Ford - end of October, MozFest 26-28/10
We are working towards having a completed model before our two big events. With Ford we will test the interest of brands in using the tool (and determine the advantages to them), and at MozFest we will do the same work with consumers.

## Milestone: Compile research
Date: 09/11
We will compile the brand and consumer research and release a paper containing the results. This information will be used in the design of the extension.

## Milestone: Tool design and development
Date: ONGOING
We will continue to prepare our tool for release.
