# trust-tools
Our cross-disciplinary team is working to design and develop tools which will redress the power imbalance which is implicit in long-winded terms and conditions, empowering customers to make informed decisions regarding their personal data, and enabling brands to demonstrate their commitment to trustworthiness and openness. Current work is focussed on a browser extension which will parse terms and conditions, compare them to user preferences, and flag any deviations.

## What do we need to do?
Which milestones are we working towards at the moment? If you see an opportunity to get involved, please drop us a note below.

## Milestone: Collaborate on decision tree modelling
Date: 26/09
This week we are working on finalising the design for the decision tree a consumer will interact with when setting their preferences. The work is based on a document sent out to nPower customers entitled 'using your personal information - our fair processing (privacy) notice'. This is available as a PDF on the nPower website.

## Milestone: Release white paper
Date: 02/10
We will publish the white paper that the team has been working on to lay the groundwork for the upcoming tool development.

## Milestone: Prepare for upcoming events
Dates: MozFest 26-28/10
We are working towards having a completed model before events. At these we will test the value of the tool from both a brand and a user perspective.

## Milestone: Compile research
Date: 09/11
We will compile the brand and consumer research and release a paper containing the results. This information will be used in the design of the extension.

## Milestone: Tool design and development
Date: ONGOING
We will continue to prepare our tool for release.
